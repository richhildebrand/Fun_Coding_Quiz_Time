###Your quirky boss collects rare, old coins...

They found out you're a programmer and asked you to solve something they've been wondering for a long time.

Write a function that, given:

1. an amount of money
2. a list of coin denominations

computes the number of ways to make the amount of money with coins of the available denominations.

**Example:** for `amount=44` (44¢) and `denominations=[1,2,3]` (11¢, 22¢ and 33¢), your program would output 44—the number of ways to make 44¢ with those denominations:

1. 1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢
2. 1¢, 1¢, 2¢
3. 1¢, 3¢
4. 2¢, 2¢
